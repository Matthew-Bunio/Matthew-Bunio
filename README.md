## About me

Hello, I'm Matthew Bunio, a student at the Manitoba Institude of Trade and Technology and I also attend ShaftesBury Highschool as my host school.

I'm a software developer that enjoys building and designing websites or other projects. I also enjoy playing video games and hanging out with my friends. I also have a part-time job and Landmark Cinemas movie theatre which I really enjoy because of my love for movies.

My three favourite languages to code in are html, CSS and Javascript. But I am very eager to learn a lot more about coding and all of the languages that will be associated with it.
